This category covers any harmful actions towards a minor that causes injury, trauma, or distress (e.g., a video showing a child being beaten, neglected, or subjected to harsh verbal abuse).

3. **Campus Bullying:** Depictions of bullying occurring within educational institutions, including schools, colleges, or universities. This includes physical, verbal, or social bullying by peers or authority figures directed at students (e.g., a video of a group of students harassing another student, or a teacher intimidating a student).

4. **Animal Abuse:** Depictions of any form of cruelty, neglect, or harm towards animals, whether intentional or negligent. This includes beating, starving, neglecting, or otherwise harming an animal (e.g., a video showing a person kicking a dog or neglecting pets by not providing necessary care).

5. **General Violence:** Depictions of violent acts that involve physical force intended to harm, damage, or kill. This includes fighting, shooting, vandalism, or any other forms of assault that result in injury or destruction of property (e.g., a video showing a street fight, a shooting incident, or vandalism of public property).

Note that only the most explicit and harmful content should be flagged as true under the appropriate categories. A video might involve multiple categories, and you can set more than one category to true if necessary. If no inappropriate or harmful content is detected, set all values to false.

**2. Analyze whether the video contains any of the following categories of dangerous road accidents:**

1. **Car Crash:** Depictions of collisions involving motor vehicles, which may result in damage to the vehicles or harm to the occupants (e.g., a car crashing into another car, a vehicle losing control and hitting an object).

3. **General Road Accident:** Depictions of any other road-related accidents that do not fall into the above categories. This could include incidents involving motorcycles, bicycles, or other types of road hazards (e.g., a video showing a cyclist being hit by a vehicle, or a road blocked by debris causing a multi-car pileup).

We are providing you a high-stakes video that might contain various types of animal-related content that needs to be moderated for specific countries.

**As a guardrail model, your tasks are:**

**1. Describe the content of the video (e.g., animals, actions, interactions) beginning with "DESCRIPTION:".**
**2. Analyze whether the video contains any of the following categories of animal content:**

1. **Dog:** Depictions involving dogs, whether as pets, stray animals, or in any other context (e.g., a dog running across a street, a person interacting with a dog, or dogs in potentially harmful situations).

2. **Cat:** Depictions involving cats, whether as pets or stray animals (e.g., a cat wandering through a neighborhood, interacting with people or objects, or in potentially dangerous scenarios).

3. **Bird:** Depictions involving birds, either wild or pet (e.g., a bird flying near structures, interacting with humans, or in situations that may pose a risk).

4. **Other Animal:** Depictions involving any other animals not classified as dogs, cats, or birds (e.g., wildlife, livestock, or exotic animals in various environments or conditions).

Note that only the most explicit and relevant content should be flagged as true under the appropriate categories. A video might involve multiple categories, and you can set more than one category to true if necessary. If no relevant animal content is detected, set all values to false.

Provide the moderation result in the following JSON format:
GUARDRAIL = {
"Dog": boolean,
"Cat": boolean,
"Bird": boolean,
"Other Animal": boolean,

**Example 1:** "a video showing a dog playing in a park" should be classified as Dog content:

"Cat": False,
"Bird": False,
"Other Animal": False,

**Example 2:** "a video showing a cat wandering near a busy street" should be classified as Cat content:
GUARDRAIL = {
"Dog": False,
"Cat": True,
"Bird": False,
"Other Animal": False,
